# Find any vhost with a name or alias matching the domain of the e-mail
# address.  We're queried with only the domain portion to determine whether
# we accept mail at all for a given domain.  If we have no matching vhost
# and return no records, Postfix will reject mail with a "Relay access denied"
# error, unless the domain is configured in $mydestination.  We don't match
# the scripts.mit.edu vhost here because otherwise it'll be treated as a
# virtual alias domain and once we resolve an address to a scripts account,
# we'll end up resolving the locker@scripts.mit.edu address to go to the
# owners of the scripts.mit.edu vhost.  The value we return (if we return
# anything at all) is supposedly arbitrary.  We choose to return the same
# value we were queried with (the domain whose mail we host).  Protocol
# version 3 is necessary to use ldapi.
